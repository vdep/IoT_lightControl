# IoT based LED light automation with Raspberry Pi
This is a Simple IoT usecase to demonstrate "machine-to-machine" (M2M) communication using [Distributed Services Architecture(DSA)](http://iot-dsa.org/)

The LED bulb turns on automatically if the room is dark (due to power failure or some other reason) and sends an email alert to the building manager regarding the same. The brightness level in the room is monitored through light sensor in an android phone.

1. The Brightness level of a living area is monitored continously with the help of light sensor in an Android phone.

2. The DSLink, residing on android phone sends the brightness level recorded by the light sensor and streams the data every second to other DSLinks. (A DSLink is a device deployable piece of code written in Java SDK. It has capability to interact with any peripheral devices connected to an Edge device/node.)

3. The DSLinks follows Pub-Sub Pattern for information passage. The DSLink on Raspberry Pi has subscribed to DSLink on the android phone, thus Raspberry Pi is able to collect brightness level data generated by light sensor.

4. The streamed data is monitored for value dipping below a threshold, indicating the light source in the living room is not functioning. Raspberry then triggers two events, Turning LED on through GPIO modules and sending email alert to the configured email address.
